                <p>
                    PmiRExAt, a new online web resource, provides the most comprehensive comparative view of plant miRNA expression in multiple tissues and developmental stages. Presently it caters pre-computed miRNA expression matrices for various plant species. These expression profiles can be used as a proxy for relative expression levels of miRNA sequences. Meta-analysis of the publicly available small RNA datasets showed significant expression patterns of several miRNA, leading to discovery of tissue preferential expressing miRNA. PmiRExAt will be very useful to plant science community for data-mining genome-wide miRNA expression across plant species. Plant researchers will be saving lot of computing analysis time and efforts for profiling miRNA expression in rich source of publicly available small-RNA data by accessing PmiRExAt pre-computed miRNA expression matrices. This resource will be enriched further by serving miRNA expression matrices for more plants species and by adding more advanced features for faster miRNA expression profiling.
